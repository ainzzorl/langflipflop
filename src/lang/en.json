  "about.p1": "LangFlipFlop is a lightweight app to practice translating from one language to another. Select a text from the list and read it one small fragment at a time. Try translating it in your head and then click of tap the text to compare your translation to ours. It's OK if the translation you had in mind doesn't match the suggestion - there can be more than one correct translation.",
  "about.p2": "LangFlipFlop doesn't exactly teach you the language, but lets you practice it on real-life examples. It works best for language learners who are somewhat comfortable with the language, but struggling to apply it when talking about certain topics.",
  "about.p3": "LangFlipFlop won't gamify your practice, won't ask you to register, won't collect any personal information, and won't bother you with notifications. Enjoy practicing your favorite language!",
