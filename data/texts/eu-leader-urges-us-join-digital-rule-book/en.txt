The European Union (EU) Tuesday called upon the United States to join the alliance in creating a common rule book to rein in the power of internet companies like Facebook and Twitter.

In a virtual speech to the Davos World Economic Forum, European Commission president Ursula von der Leyen called on U.S. President Joe Biden to join the 27-nation bloc’s efforts to better regulate tech platforms.
She added there needs to be a "framework" for "far-reaching decisions" such as Twitter's move to cut off former U.S. President Donald Trump's account.

She said it needs to be clearly laid out how internet companies make decisions about disseminating, promoting or removing content.  

“No matter how tempting it may have been for Twitter to switch off President Trump's account,
such serious interference with freedom of expression should not be based on company rules alone,” said Von der Leyen.
“There needs to be a framework of laws for such far-reaching decision.”
