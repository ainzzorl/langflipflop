My Language Learning Technique
hi there steve kaufman here just
finishing off on apple
[Music]
um today i want to share with you some
of the things that i do at link
how i learn my languages uh remember if
you enjoy my videos
please subscribe uh click on the
tap on the bell here or click on it in
order to get notifications and
come and join us at link so obviously if
i share what i do how i learn
languages i'm going to refer to link
because that's where
i learn languages i also happen to think
it's very useful i put a lot of my
you know time and life into it over the
last 15 years i believe in it
i think it's good i want to share it
with other people
hi just wanted to interrupt to update
you on my
statistics in the 90 day challenge
finished month 2
so i'm showing you statistics for the
whole month of october
my goal is to get to 20 000 known words
which means i need to have
2 000 new known words each month i got
pretty close in the month of october
you'll see how i do that in the video
you'll see how
the words in my transcripts of my
algeria
al jazeera podcast are more and more
white and fewer and fewer words are
yellow or
blue and i understand them a little
better but it's a long road and i think
it's a good thing to
to share what we're doing in in learning
languages
uh that's one of the things uh in my
presentation at the polyglot conference
i was sharing some of the things that i
did how i collect
um content to learn from
and i have indicated they would be fun
you know as we're all hunkered down and
covet
and particularly older people who maybe
have loose ends or
you know i'm lucky i have a fairly large
house and i can go to the golf course
but some people don't have that
opportunity like the great thing about
the golf course is that it's it's an
opportunity to be
social without being in a room with
someone
so we meet all kinds of different people
some of whom we know some we don't know
and
it's social and we play i play very poor
golf but
but many people don't have that so i
thought it would be fun to get together
and share our experiences in language
learning and maybe encourage some
people including seniors to get more
active in learning
languages by the way next tuesday we're
going to do a
live stream in espanol with shelby
on the different things that we do on
links so that'll be live streamed
on tuesday 10 o'clock i think vancouver
or pacific standard time
so it's fun to share what we do um
i by the way i contacted her we one of
the people in our office contacted the
seniors group here
in vancouver to suggest that we could do
a live stream with seniors and talk
about language learning and
their comment was well is your
organization for profit
uh you're not allowed to talk about any
for-profit
uh thing that you're doing so i said
that's okay don't worry about it we
needn't bother
uh having the session because if i'm
gonna talk about language learning i'm
gonna talk about link because that's
what i do
anyway so with that what do i two things
that i've been doing recently that may
be of interest to you
one is because i'm in this um you know
90 day challenge i'm sort of under
under the gun i want to increase my
known words
total and every week i do a little
summary of my statistics
and you'll see that my known words total
is growing
but i have two major activities which
i'm going to share with you now
i did a a sort of a screen share on my
ipad for whatever reason
i tried to explain what i was doing and
that sound was not
recorded so you'll just see sort of
silently what i do
but the sound that did come through was
the sound that comes from the ipad
so i'm going to show two things i'm
going to show first of all
how i go to the vocabulary section
select status three words
have them in order of importance so that
the most frequent ones show up first
and then i go through there and discover
that in fact
i know a minute i have 50 000 saved
links
so status three i don't know how many
but there are thousands of words that i
have moved to status
three because either when i'm reading or
whatever and i feel i know it a little
better now and i kind of
shoved it along the status three so i
get go into the vocab section i
there's like 45 pages of status three
words
and either i start at the top which is
the most free you know the highest
frequency ones
or sometimes i'll just select page 16 of
45 and start going through there
and i normally will find lots of words
that i know
already and so i go through there every
day try to get
a hundred of them so if i can keep doing
that then i'm gonna move my known words
total to
uh that twenty thousand number i have
the feeling that with twenty
000 that will kind of be a bit of a
milestone in terms of my comprehension
comprehension of these podcasts that i
get from al jazeera
so i will show you how i do that
and uh so that'll be one thing so you
i've explained you know what you are
going to see
it's going to be me at the vocabulary
page
uh ticking off moving some first of all
selecting for status three words you'll
see that
and then uh deciding that i know this
word and moving it to known which is the
tick mark
i do this you know i'm not too tough on
myself
if i kind of think i know it or i would
recognize it in context
i move it to know because when i'm
reading through
texts at link these will now show up as
white they won't
be shaded yellow and they certainly
won't be blue
if i find that i don't know them again i
can move them back
but i like it when i get into my texts
and i see a few yellow words
very few blue words gives me that sense
that i'm getting somewhere
and but yeah if i find in fact i don't
know the word
i move it back i don't demand of myself
that i'm able to remember them and use
them
because again my attitude is if i can
achieve a good level of comprehension so
that i can just listen to podcasts and
listen to arabic and i'm just listening
all the time and understanding
the speaking will come as i speak more
but
i don't need to beat myself up on what
does it mean to know a word if i think i
kind of know that in context
good enough i give myself credit for the
word it also nice
it's nice to sort of bump up your
statistics gives you the sense you're
achieving something
so that's that now the second thing that
i do
is and and this gets back to a number of
people have pointed out that it's
sometimes useful to
listen to the target language and read
in your own language
uh i did some of that when i was
learning
czech and i would listen to the good
soldier schweich
schweik in czech and try and read it in
english but
very soon you fall behind and there's
too many words that you don't know
so you're kind of able to follow along
while listening to the target language
and
reading but there's a lot of words that
you miss so what i find
really useful now is that um
if i get the transcript so i get my mp3
file
of the al jazeera which i am unable to
extract but
my assistant in morocco does that for me
and every week she sends me three
mp3 files i put those mp3 files on
to happyscribe.com i
select show date stamps when i
have them printed out the transcripts
with the date stamps
i have uh incen and i have to import
them as
as an e-book into link you have to
import it as an e-book
i should have perhaps shown that but
nevertheless you have to import it as an
e-book
but what i'm going to show you is how in
sentence mode
i'm able to hear the natural voice of
each sentence
some sentences are short some sentences
are longer
so i'm going to show you two segments
here one is a short sentence where there
are no blue words
another one is a longer segment and i
won't go through the whole thing
but you can hear the natural voice of
the podcast
uh i can then go back over the words
that i'm still trying to learn the
yellow words or the blue words
if i'm going to convert blue words and
then i hear the text to speech
and people have commented before that
the text to speech is often
not as accurate as the natural voice but
that's why it's so nice to hear
the natural voice voice for these
segments in sentence mode
but you have to get the transcript with
date stamps which is the case if i get
them on
happy transcribe i ask to show the date
stamps
i import them as an ebook that's how you
have to import them otherwise the date
stamps disappear
if you bring something in from youtube
it is also a date stand
and there again you can look at it in
sentence mode
if you bring something in from youtube
uh
interlink then you actually see the
video
as well as the audio for each uh for
each sentence
when you go to listen away from the
iphone or ipad or whatever then of
course you're listening to the whole
text
okay so that was just a little bit of a
oh yeah i should let you listen to that
so i'll put that on now you can we'll
just close out with that you can see
what i'm doing when i'm studying in
sentence mode
these podcast transcripts
i just noticed that the last word the
blue word that i
clicked on was in fact uh not an it was
like
two words squished together so some of
you who know arabic might have noticed
that
uh occasionally the happy scribe makes a
mistake
very very seldom but it happens
it's not enough to disturb me and i
think it's important
to always have an attitude in learning
languages that we are going to come
across mistakes native speakers make
mistakes
people criticize the text-to-speech
which makes mistakes
but it all helps nevertheless we don't
need perfection
so i thought i'd just jump in there and
mention that in case i started getting
comments saying that that was a squished
word okay anyway don't go for perfection
just go for enjoyment and improvement
bye for now
